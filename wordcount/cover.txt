Hello

My name is Misa Zivanovic.

My greatest passion in life is sharing knowledge with other people, and helping, motivating others to achieve their goals.

When a student informs me that he or she passed an IELTS or TOEFL exam, or that they got promoted thanks to their new skill, knowing that I was there with them along the way, to guide them, to give them confidence and knowledge, warms my heart and keeps me motivated to become an even better teacher.

I have over 4 years of online teaching experience and also I used to work in sales and procurement for a company in Serbia.

So I believe that I am well suited for this position, as I know and understand difficulties adults and businessmen, and businesswomen, face when they are talking in a foreign language.

Especially if the subject of the conversation is business.

I will gladly support all of my students through this wonderful journey of acquiring knowledge and giving them the confidence to apply it, in the real world.

Even though my English is on a native level, I know the difficulties and struggles of learning a new language, so I can always find a way to explain something, a phrase, word, or pronunciation to a student in an easy to understand way.

I really hope to hear from you in the near future :)

All the best :)

Misa Zivanovic
